# GitHub Pages Deployment

This branch is ready to be published as a GitHub Page. To deploy:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on "Settings" > "Pages".
3. Under "Source", select the `AbacusRev1` branch and set the root to `/`.
4. Save.

Your site will be available at:
`https://<your-username>.github.io/AbacusRev0/`

Make sure your `index.html` is at the root of the repository (which it is).

No further configuration is needed for a static site like this.
